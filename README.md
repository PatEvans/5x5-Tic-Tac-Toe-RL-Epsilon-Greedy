Randomly Trained Agent vs Random Agent:

Trained over 400,000 games with a decreasing value for epsilon. Where epsilon represents the probability that for each move in a training game, a random rather than a greedy move is selected.

For the first 100,000 games: Epsilon = 1
For the second 100,000 games: Epsilon = 0.2
For the third 100,000 games: Epsilon = 0.1
For the last 100,000 games: Epsilon = 0.05
